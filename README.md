# Tetradunes
This is a game which works just like Tetris but with a twist, the blocks here are made up of sand!!!

Tetradunes is a unique and engaging twist on the classic block-stacking puzzle game. Set in a serene desert landscape, players guide and arrange falling blocks to form complete rows and keep the board clear. Can you handle the heat and master the dunes?
